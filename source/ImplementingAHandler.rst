How to Implement a Request Handler
----------------------------------

To implement a handler, derive from RequestHandler<T> where T should be
the **Command** or **Event** derived type that you wish to handle. Then
override the base class Handle() method to implement your handling for
the Command or Event.

For example, assume that you want to handle the **Command**
GreetingCommand

.. highlight:: csharp

::

    public class GreetingCommand : IRequest
    {
        public GreetingCommand(string name)
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid();
            Name = name;
        }

        public Guid Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; private set; }
    }


Then derive your handler from **RequestHandler<GreetingCommand>** and
accept a parameter of that type on the overriden **Handle()** method.

.. highlight:: csharp

::

    public class GreetingCommandHandler : RequestHandler<GreetingCommand>
    {
        public override GreetingCommand Handle(GreetingCommand command)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello {0}", command.Name);
            return base.Handle(command);
        }
    }


What is the difference between a Command and an Event?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use the term **Request** for a data object containing parameters that
you want to dispatch to a handler. Brighter uses the interface
**IRequest** for this concept. Confusingly, both **Command** or
**Event** which implement **IRequest** are examples of the `Command
Pattern <https://brightercommand.github.io/Brighter/CommandsCommandDispatcherandProcessor.html>`__. It is easiest
to say that within Brighter **IRequest** is the abstraction that
represents the Command from the `Command
Pattern <https://brightercommand.github.io/Brighter/CommandsCommandDispatcherandProcessor.html>`__.

Why have both **Command** and **Event**? The difference is in how the
**Command Dispatcher** dispatches them to handlers.

-  A **Command** is an imperative instruction to do something; it only
   has one handler. We will throw an error for multiple registered
   handlers of a command.
-  An **Event** is a notification that something has happened; it has
   zero or more handlers.

The difference is best explained by the following analogy. If I say
"Bob, make me a cup of coffee," I am giving a Command, an imperative
instruction. My expectation is that Bob will make me coffee. If Bob does
not, then we have a failure condition (and I am thirsty and cranky). If
I say "I could do with a cup of coffee," then I am indicating a state of
thirst and caffeine-withdrawal. If Bob or Alice make me a coffee I will
be very grateful, but there is no expectation that they will.

So choosing between **Command** or **Event** effects how the **Command
Dispatcher** routes requests.

See `Dispatching a Request <DispatchingARequest.html>`__ for more on how
to dispatch **Requests** to handlers.
